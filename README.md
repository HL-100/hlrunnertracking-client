## App Description


## Problem Statement
Race organizers for the High Lonesome 100 (a hundred mile trail race) currently use pen and paper and duplicate note transfers to keep track of the trail racers.  This is time-consuming and volunteer intensive.  High Lonesome 100 is looking for a better way to keep track of trail racers, so that time can be spent attending to racers needs and their safety.

## Solution
The App Trail Tracker automates trail runner tracking.

Trail Tracker quickly allows volunteers at aid-station checkpoints to record the trail runners time and any special needs that may arise.  Providing important information to all members of the High Lonesome 100 team.  

Trail Tracker puts the focus back on what is important.  The trail runners safety and each individual's will to win.
